#### Overview on out Clean Architecture implementation.

1. CommunityLibrary.Core (src/CommunityLibrary.Core)
   Role: Contains the core business logic and entities.
   Summary: This project defines the fundamental structure of the application, including entities, interfaces, and business rules that are independent of external concerns.

2. CommunityLibrary.Application (src/CommunityLibrary.Application)
   Role: Implements application-specific business rules and use cases.
   Summary: This layer orchestrates the flow of data between the UI (API) and the domain layer, implementing business logic that depends on the core entities.

3. CommunityLibrary.Infrastructure (src/CommunityLibrary.Infrastructure)
   Role: Provides implementations for external concerns.
   Summary: This project contains implementations of interfaces defined in the Core and Application layers, including database access, external services, and other infrastructure concerns.

4. CommunityLibrary.Api (src/CommunityLibrary.Api)
   Role: Handles HTTP requests and serves as the entry point for the application.
   Summary: This project exposes the application's functionality through API endpoints, handling request/response cycles and coordinating with the Application layer.

5. CommunityLibrary.WebUI (src/CommunityLibrary.WebUI)
   Role: Provides the user interface for the application.
   Summary: This Blazor WebAssembly project will serve as the front-end, interacting with the API to provide a user interface for the library management system.

Interaction Flow:

1. The user interacts with the WebUI (Blazor WebAssembly).
2. WebUI makes HTTP requests to the Api project.
3. Api controllers receive the requests and call appropriate methods in the Application layer (services).
4. Application services implement business logic, using entities and interfaces defined in the Core project.
5. When data access is needed, Application services call repository methods defined in the Core project and implemented in the Infrastructure project.
6. The Infrastructure project interacts with the database or external services as needed.
7. Results flow back up through the layers: Infrastructure → Application → Api → WebUI.

This architecture ensures:
- Separation of concerns
- Independence of the core business logic from external frameworks
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Flexibility to change external dependencies without affecting the core business logic

The dependencies flow inwards: WebUI/Api → Application → Core, and Infrastructure → Core. The Core project has no dependencies on other projects, maintaining the independence of the business logic.

#### What't the role of mapping

1. Separation of Concerns:
   - Entities (in the Core layer) represent our database structure.
   - DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) represent the data structure we use for API requests and responses.
   - Mapping allows us to keep these separate, which is a key principle of clean architecture.

2. Data Protection:
   - We can exclude sensitive information (like password hashes) from DTOs, ensuring they're not accidentally exposed through the API.

3. Flexibility in API Design:
   - We can shape our API responses without changing our database structure.
   - Different DTOs can be created for different use cases (e.g., a summary DTO vs. a detailed DTO).

4. Simplification of Complex Relationships:
   - We can flatten complex object hierarchies into simpler structures for API consumers.

5. Type Conversion:
   - AutoMapper can handle type conversions (like enums to strings) automatically.

Let's look at some specific examples from our `MappingProfile`:

```csharp
CreateMap<Book, BookDto>().ReverseMap();
```
This creates a two-way mapping between `Book` and `BookDto`. Any properties with the same name will be automatically mapped.

```csharp
CreateMap<User, UserDto>()
    .ForMember(dest => dest.Role, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.Role.ToString()))
    .ReverseMap()
    .ForMember(dest => dest.Role, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => Enum.Parse<UserRole>(src.Role)));
```
This mapping handles the conversion between the `UserRole` enum in the `User` entity and the string representation in `UserDto`.

```csharp
CreateMap<Reservation, ReservationDto>()
    .ForMember(dest => dest.UserName, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.User.Username))
    .ForMember(dest => dest.BookTitle, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.Book.Title))
    .ReverseMap();
```
This mapping flattens the relationship between `Reservation`, `User`, and `Book`. Instead of nested objects, the DTO includes just the username and book title.

Benefits in our application:

1. In services (like `BookService`), we can work with entities internally but return DTOs:
   ```csharp
   var book = await _bookRepository.GetByIdAsync(id);
   return _mapper.Map<BookDto>(book);
   ```

2. In controllers, we can accept DTOs in requests and return DTOs in responses, keeping our API consistent and our internal models hidden.

3. We can easily add or remove fields from our API responses by modifying DTOs and mappings, without changing our core entities.

4. It reduces the amount of manual mapping code we need to write, making our services cleaner and less error-prone.

By using AutoMapper and this mapping profile, we're ensuring a clear separation between our internal data structures and our API contract, providing flexibility, security, and maintainability to our application.
