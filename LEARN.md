Overview on out Clean Architecture implementation.

1. CommunityLibrary.Core (src/CommunityLibrary.Core)
   Role: Contains the core business logic and entities.
   Summary: This project defines the fundamental structure of the application, including entities, interfaces, and business rules that are independent of external concerns.

2. CommunityLibrary.Application (src/CommunityLibrary.Application)
   Role: Implements application-specific business rules and use cases.
   Summary: This layer orchestrates the flow of data between the UI (API) and the domain layer, implementing business logic that depends on the core entities.

3. CommunityLibrary.Infrastructure (src/CommunityLibrary.Infrastructure)
   Role: Provides implementations for external concerns.
   Summary: This project contains implementations of interfaces defined in the Core and Application layers, including database access, external services, and other infrastructure concerns.

4. CommunityLibrary.Api (src/CommunityLibrary.Api)
   Role: Handles HTTP requests and serves as the entry point for the application.
   Summary: This project exposes the application's functionality through API endpoints, handling request/response cycles and coordinating with the Application layer.

5. CommunityLibrary.WebUI (src/CommunityLibrary.WebUI)
   Role: Provides the user interface for the application.
   Summary: This Blazor WebAssembly project will serve as the front-end, interacting with the API to provide a user interface for the library management system.

Interaction Flow:

1. The user interacts with the WebUI (Blazor WebAssembly).
2. WebUI makes HTTP requests to the Api project.
3. Api controllers receive the requests and call appropriate methods in the Application layer (services).
4. Application services implement business logic, using entities and interfaces defined in the Core project.
5. When data access is needed, Application services call repository methods defined in the Core project and implemented in the Infrastructure project.
6. The Infrastructure project interacts with the database or external services as needed.
7. Results flow back up through the layers: Infrastructure → Application → Api → WebUI.

This architecture ensures:
- Separation of concerns
- Independence of the core business logic from external frameworks
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Flexibility to change external dependencies without affecting the core business logic

The dependencies flow inwards: WebUI/Api → Application → Core, and Infrastructure → Core. The Core project has no dependencies on other projects, maintaining the independence of the business logic.
